        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-center w3-margin-top">
      <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vcwitqpc5b?embed"
              class="desmos-frame" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      First, to make the function show a growing trend, we applied a reflection, which could be done over
      either the x or y axis. In our case, we chose the x-axis. As \(x\) approaches 0, the function begins
      to change rapidly because \(x\) is in the denominator. So, we decided to apply a vertical stretch.
      We found that it best fits the bottom of the pirate ship when the value of \(a\) is between 40 and 50,
      ultimately settling on 45.8. Finally, we adjusted the asymptote to the pirate ship's position by adding
      a horizontal translation of 10.9 units to the right and a vertical translation of 12 units downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      To capture the remaining portion, we add the second function. Similar to the first function, this one
      also needs to be reflected first. Since the remaining part of the pirate ship is quite steep, no
      significant changes were needed. We began with a vertical stretch, then aligned the curve with the
      pirate ship by applying a horizontal translation of 8 units to the right and a vertical translation
      of 2.3 units downwards. At this point, the top of the curve is positioned very close to the top of
      the pirate ship, so we applied a horizontal compression by a factor of 1.8 and adjusted the vertical
      stretch from 4 to 3.9 to make the function’s graph fit the entire ride.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Domain and Range</h4>
    <p>
      For the first function, it fits from the leftmost point of the pirate ship near \((0.5,-7.6)\) to
      \((7.1,0.05)\), thus:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(g(x)\) Domain: \([0.5, 7.1]\)</li>
      <li>\(g(x)\) Range: \([-7.6, 0.05]\) (rounded)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The second function continues from \(x = 7.1\) to \(x = 7.65\), reaching approximately \((7.65,3.89)\).
      Although the horizontal span is short, the curve is steep, producing a large vertical change; hence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(h(x)\) Domain: \([7.1, 7.65]\)</li>
      <li>\(h(x)\) Range: \([0.11, 3.89]\) (rounded)</li>
    </ul>

      <img src="img/skull-cutlass.jpg" alt="Skull and Cutlasses" class="ride-photo">
    </div>

    <p>
      The second type of function is the reciprocal of \(x^2\) function. With Halloween approaching,
      the amusement park is filled with various seasonal decorations. This ride adopts a horror
      theme—decorated with a skull and two pirate cutlasses. You will see it as soon as you walk
      into the park. Come and try! Good luck!

    <h3>Parent Function</h3>

    <p class="w3-margin-top">
      Below the two pirate cutlasses, there are two excellent arcs that match the reciprocal of
      \(x^2\) function perfectly. The pirate cutlass on the left is like a function growing from

          <li>Horizontally translate 6.1 units to the left</li>
          <li>Vertically translate 3.7 units downwards</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Left Cutlass</h4>
        <p>
          \( j(x) = 8.2\cdot \dfrac{1}{0.1(x-6.6)^2} - 3.7,\quad -3.5 \le x \le 2.9 \)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vertically stretch by a factor of 8.2</li>
          <li>Horizontally stretch by a factor of 10</li>
          <li>Horizontally translate 6.6 units to the right</li>
          <li>Vertically translate 3.7 units downwards</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      We took the right part of the parent function, as it is decreasing from the second to the fourth
      quadrant. To make the parent function reach the pirate cutlass below, we made a vertical translation
      3.7 units downwards. But the bottom left corner is too vertical; to make it smoother, we chose to
      vertically stretch by a factor of 8.2. Now, the bottom left corner has become much flatter. However,
      compared to the curve of the pirate cutlass, the upper part is still too vertical, so we decided to
      horizontally stretch it by a factor of 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pirate cutlass is modeled similarly using the other branch of the parent function, with
      horizontal translation adjusted to the right. In both cases, the transformations allow the curves
      to closely match the decorative blades.
    </p>

      <img src="img/sunway-coaster.jpg" alt="Cubic Coaster" class="ride-photo">
    </div>

    <p>
      At Sunway Lagoon, this roller coaster is the most thrilling and exciting. Moreover, the track
      on this section of the roller coaster perfectly coincides with a cubic function. We chose a cubic
      function to fit this image, as this roller coaster track has a highest and lowest point, which
      matches the characteristics of the cubic function.
    </p>

    <h3>Parent Function</h3>
    <p>\( y = x(x-5.6)(x+8.6) \)</p>
    <p>
      Because the entire ride could not be fully photographed from the photographer’s angle, we estimated
      the key points in order to determine the function. This function passes through the point \((0, 0)\).
      We also speculated that it has x-intercepts at approximately \((5.6, 0)\) and \((-8.6, 0)\), which is
      why we selected this curve as our parent function.
    </p>

    <div class="w3-center">

    <p class="w3-margin-top">
      We spotted this track while waiting in line for the roller coaster, which reminded us of the polynomial
      function. The track had a highest and lowest point, perfectly matching our expectations for the polynomial
      function, so we chose it.

    <h3 class="w3-margin-top">Transformed Function</h3>
    <p>
      \( y = 0.0121 \cdot x(x-5.6)(x+8.6) + 0.1,\quad -5 \le x \le 4.8 \)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vertically compress by a factor of 0.0121</li>
      <li>Vertically translate up 0.1 units</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the previous text, we speculated this function passes through the points
      \((0,0)\), \((5.6,0)\) and \((-8.6,0)\), so we had our parent function. However, the portion
      between \((-8.6,0)\) and \((0,0)\) is too steep as well as the part between \((0,0)\) and
      \((5.6,0)\); as a result, we vertically compressed the function by a factor of 0.0121.
      Then we found the function is too low compared to the image, so we vertically translate
      the function 0.1 unit up.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Domain and Range</h4>
    <p>
      Because of the limitation of the image, we had to restrict the domain and range of this function.
      The function decreases from the point \((-5, 2.4)\) to \((3.1, -1)\) (rounded), passing through
      the point \((0, 0)\). Then, the function starts to increase from \((3.1, -1)\) to \((4.8, -0.52)\)
      (rounded). So we have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Domain: \([-5, 4.8]\)</li>
      <li>Range: \([-1, 2.4]\) (rounded)</li>

      0 and 1 for our exponential function. However, because the graph of the function increases too rapidly
      as it approaches negative infinity, while the slope of the slide is much gentler, we added an additional
      function to fully match the ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first moved the function downward by 3.5 units to bring its asymptote closer to the ground. Then,
      because it changed too rapidly when approaching negative infinity, we shifted it 8 units to the left,
      at which point the graph intersected the slide. The left half of the graph had a very large curvature,
      so we applied a horizontal stretch by a factor of 5 (≈ \(1/0.2\)) to make it flatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the graph was below the slide, we applied a vertical stretch by a factor of 4. At this point,
      the graph was almost aligned with the ride, but it was still slightly above it, so we moved it
      downward by another 0.5 units (a total translation of 4 units). We then made some slight adjustment
      by changing the horizontal stretch from 5 to 5.26 and the vertical stretch from 4 to 4.1. At this
      point, the graph aligned perfectly with the ride except for a small portion on the far right.
      Because this section of the slide is almost a straight line, we modified the position of the asymptote
      of the same function to the upper left to create a new function. Finally, the two functions together
      covered the entire ride.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Domain and Range</h4>
    <p>
      Because the slide is very gentle, the ranges of the two functions do not vary significantly. The range
      of the left function is between –3.33 and 0.8. Since the part on the right lies very close to the ground
      and is almost a straight line, its range is even smaller, from –3.46 to –3.34. The domains of the two
      functions connect with no gap, covering the entire slide from –10 to 10.

      Next is the logarithmic function, modeled after the Freefall Tube Slide from Sunway Lagoon.
      In contrast to the last ride, this one is an extreme drop slide with a slope that is almost
      90 degrees. The two rides form a strong contrast, just like exponential and logarithmic
      functions, which are inverse to each other.

    <h3 class="w3-margin-top">Transformed Function</h3>
    <p>
      \( g(x) = 8\log_{0.5}\big(2.8(x+1)\big) + 30,\quad 1.3 \le x \le 6.4 \)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vertical stretch by a factor of 8</li>
      <li>Horizontal compression by a factor of 0.357 (≈ \(1/2.8\))</li>
      <li>Horizontal translation 1 unit to the left</li>
      <li>Vertical translation 30 units upwards</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      Unlike the last function, this ride is much steeper than the parent logarithmic function.
      So we first applied a vertical stretch by a factor of 4 to make the curve match the shape
      of the slide. After applying the vertical and horizontal translations, we noticed a similar
      issue as before: only the middle part aligned with the ride because the curvature did not
      match the slide.
    </p>
    <p>
      To increase the steepness, we strengthened the vertical stretch to a factor of 8. Even then,
      the angle was still not steep enough, so we tried a horizontal compression by a factor of 1/3.
      After observing the graph, we found that the part where the curvature increases rapidly closely
      matched the downward slope of the slide. We then moved the curved part upward by 30 units.
      At this point, the graph was very close, but it was slightly too far to the right, so we shifted
      it 1 unit to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, we realized that the horizontal compression of 1/3 was a bit too strong, so we adjusted
      it to 1/2.8 (changing from approximately 0.33 to about 0.357). Finally, the graph fits almost
      the entire slide perfectly.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Domain and Range</h4>
    <p>
      This time, because the Freefall Tube Slide is extremely steep, its domain is relatively small,
      ranging from 1.3 to 6.4. However, its range is much larger, from approximately –5 to 8.5.
    </p>

      <li>Vertical translation 11 units upwards</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      We observed that the bottom part, which is below the x-axis, has a curve at the top.
      In contrast, the upper part of the function has a curve at the bottom. In this case,
      we chose to use the bottom part which is below the x-axis. First, we raised it up
      because it was under the x-axis. Then, we noticed that the curve at the top was too narrow,
      so we applied a horizontal stretch by a factor of \(25/13\). However, the function still
      deviated from the image, so we slightly moved the function 2.9 units to the right.
      Finally, the curves at the top left and top right corners were too blunt, and the function
      was a bit too high, so we made an improvement: vertically stretch by a factor of 1.9.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Domain and Range</h4>
    <p>
      As the length of this roller coaster was limited by the “photographer”, we have to restrict
      its domain and range. The domain of this part starts from –2.96 to 2.72. The range of this
      portion is quite interesting: it starts growing from –9.2, then reaches its peak at 9.1,
      finally decreases to –9.3. The lowest point is –9.3, so we use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Domain: \([-2.96, 2.72]\)</li>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      Interestingly, the four functions use almost the same transformations: the amplitude \(A\)
      remains nearly unchanged (approximately 1). As the periods of these functions are slightly
      longer than the parent function, we stretched them horizontally by factors of roughly 0.78
      on average to fit the image. The phase shifts \(d\) and vertical translations \(c\) vary only
      to adjust local alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four domain intervals are contiguous and meet exactly at the endpoints:
      \([-8,-3]\), \([-3,2]\), \([2,5]\), \([5,10]\), together covering \([-8,10]\) with no gaps.
      Because the amplitude is almost the same across the functions, the range is nearly identical
      as well, lying approximately between 2.93 and 4.7 (rounded).

    <p>
      The first step that we took is stretching horizontally to align the bottom of the function graph
      with the opening of the amusement park ride. However, the bottom of the function is still flat,
      so we stretched the function vertically by a factor of 4. After this, we got a good curve on the
      graph, but we needed to drag it down since it was still above the ride. We translated it down
      7.38 units. Finally, to make the curve fit the image even better, we translated it 0.2 units to the left.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Domain and Range</h4>

      Although this graph shows the whole ride, we still need to limit its domain and range. The function

    <h4 class="w3-margin-top">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
      Absolute value functions are quite straightforward to explain. If they lie above the x-axis,
      then they don't need to be reflected about the x-axis. Conversely, if they lie below the x-axis,
      then they do, and we add a negative sign in front of the function. All we need to do is vertically
      stretch, compress, or reflect it on the x-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are describing the function in terms of the spokes of a Ferris wheel, so we need to restrict
      the range and domain from the central axle to the cabins. We consider the central axis of the
      Ferris wheel as the origin of the function and the cabin as the endpoint to restrict the range
      and domain, which gives us the domain and range for each function.
